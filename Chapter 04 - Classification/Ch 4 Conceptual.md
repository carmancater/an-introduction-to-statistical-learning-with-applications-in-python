## Problem 1

Proof that the logistic function representation and logit representation for the logistic regression model are the same.

$$P(x) = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 X}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 X}}$$

Note that $$1 - P(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 X}}$$

Multiplying both sides of $P(x)$ by $\frac{1}{1 - P(x)}$ yields the desired result

$$\frac{P(x)}{1-P(x)} = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 X}$$
